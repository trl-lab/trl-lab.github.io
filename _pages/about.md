Welcome to the page of the Table Representation Learning (TRL) Lab âœ¨!

<!-- 
```The objective of our research is to democratize insights from structured data.``` -->

Our research is focused on representation learning and generative models for structured data, typically relational tables. While most AI research attends to images and text data, proportional progress on structured data is lacking. Structured data, however, is prevaling in the data landscape and actually contains highly valuable information that empowers important decisions in, for example, governments, enterprises, and healthcare. Our research spans machine learning, databases, information retrieval, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction.

The TRL Lab is led by <a href="https://www.madelonhulsebos.com">dr. ir. Madelon Hulsebos</a>, and <a href="/people" target="blank">hosts an excellent group</a> of postdoc, PhD, and master-level researchers at CWI. The lab is also affiliated with the <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/research/table-representation-learning/" target="blank">Table Representation Learning research theme</a> at ELLIS unit Amsterdam, where we organize the <a href="/trl-seminar" target="blank">TRL seminar</a> and <a href="/trl-reading-group" target="blank">reading group</a>. Beyond CWI, we currently collaborate with researchers at the University of Amsterdam, UC Berkeley, the UN Humanitarian Data Centre, and Google Research. The lab is currently funded by an AiNed grant from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and an industry grant from SAP.
