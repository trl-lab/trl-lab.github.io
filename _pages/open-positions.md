### Long-term & funded research positions

We have two open positions for PhD researchers to start in Fall 2025 or Winter 2025/2026:

<ol>
    <li><b>PhD on Responsible Mechanisms for AI-Powered Data Analysis</b></li>
    The anticipated research will focus on developing mechanisms for "responsible" (responsible in a broad sense) AI-powered data analysis systems. The research directions can involve human-computer interaction aspects such as interpretability and interfaces, and/or be focused on specialization for applications such as data preparation, etc. Interest in making positive societal impact is desired.
    <li><b>PhD on Fundemantal Mechanisms for Table Representation Learning</b></li>
    This research will focus on fundamental modeling techniques for structured data such as relational tables. This can involve, for example, studying new model architectures, serialization methods, and tokenization techniques, among other.
</ol>

Both PhDs are in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, which will also be the degree-granting university.
