Website launched for our new Table Representation Learning Lab: the TRL Lab :sparkles:!

---

Welcome! The TRL Lab hosts <a href="/people/" target="blank">researchers</a> who are motivated to advance the state of the art in Table Representation Learning in order to democratize insights from structured data.

The lab was established in September 2024 when <a href="https://www.madelonhulsebos.com">Madelon Hulsebos </a> joined CWI after having received the AiNed fellowship grant of more than $1M to pursue the lab's mission. Another grant from SAP will support our investigation of real-world data, challenges and use-cases.

Soon after establishment, the lab was joined by Daniel Gomm (PhD), Liang Telkamp (MSc), Cornelius Wolff (PhD) and Xue (Effy) Li (postdoc). Interested in joining us? Please check out our <a href="/open-positions/" target="blank">open positions</a>!

Research is done better together, hence we generally work in multidisciplinary and multi-affiliated teams. Currently, we are collaborating with researchers of diverse backgrounds at the University of Amsterdam, UC Berkeley, the United Nations, and Google.
